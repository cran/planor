\title{  Methods for function \code{summary} in package \pkg{planor} }
\description{
  Summarize the design properties of an object, by
printing the summary of each key matrix
}
\usage{
\S4method{summary}{designkey}(object, show="dtbw", save="k", \dots)

\S4method{summary}{keymatrix}(object, fact, block,  show="dtbw", save="k", \dots)

\S4method{summary}{keyring}(object, show="tbw",save ="kw", \dots)

\S4method{summary}{listofdesignkeys}(object, show="tbw", save="kw", \dots)

\S4method{summary}{listofkeyrings}(object,  show="tbw",  save="kw", \dots)
}
\note{
  The number of rows and columns of the matrices that are printed
  are limited by the option \code{planor.max.print}.
}
\value{
  A list. See Details\cr
  Information returned for each key matrix
  depends on the argument \code{save}.
  \itemize{
    \item When \code{save} includes the character 'k',
    the returned list has a component named 'k'.It is a matrix,
    the columns of which are kernel generators of the key matrices.
   \item When \code{save} includes the character 'w',
the returned list has a component named 'w', which contains
the  weight profiles of the
	effects confounded with the mean.
}
}


\details{
  The amount of display depends on the   value
  of the argument \code{show}, and the type of returned information
    depends on the   value
   of the argument \code{save}.
   
  \itemize{
 \item When \code{object} is of class
    \code{\linkS4class{keymatrix}},
    \dQuote{summary} prints the key matrix, the factorial
	effects confounded with the mean, and the weight profiles of the
	effects confounded with the mean, according to the value
	of the argument \code{show}.\cr
	The \code{\linkS4class{keymatrix}} argument being denoted by \code{key},\cr
- The rows of \code{key} are associated with units factors (or pseudofactors)
while its columns are associated with treatment or block factors (or pseudofactors).\cr
- The vectors in the arguments \code{fact} and \code{block} give information on the treatment and block factors,
so that their length is expected to be equal to the number of columns of \code{key}.\cr
- If missing, \code{fact} attributes a distinct parent factor to each
column of \code{key} and \code{block} is set to TRUE for all columns.

\dQuote{summary} returns a list with the components required by the  argument \code{save}.
\item When \code{object} is of class \code{\linkS4class{designkey}},
\dQuote{summary} prints the summary of each of the key matrices.
It returns a list with as many components as key matrices, each one with
the components required by the  argument \code{save}.

    \item When \code{object} is of class
    \code{\linkS4class{listofdesignkeys}},
    \dQuote{summary} prints the summary of each key matrix in each
    design key. It returns a list with as many components as design keys,
    each one is a list of the  key matrices summaries. 
    \item When \code{object} is of class
    \code{\linkS4class{listofkeyrings}},
    \dQuote{summary} prints  the summary of each key matrix in each
    keyring.  It returns a list with as many components as keyrings,
    each one is a list of the  key matrices summaries. 
    \item When \code{object} is of class
    \code{\linkS4class{keyring}},
    \dQuote{summary} prints   the summary of each of its key matrices.
    It returns a list with as many components as  key matrices.

\arguments{
  \item{object}{an object of the class}
  \item{fact}{a character or numeric vector of parent factor names for
    the columns of the object}
\item{block}{a logical vector to identify the columns of the object
  associated with a block factor}
\item{show}{ an optional string to  identify the
  type of information to display. The recognized letters are: 'd' for the design keys matrices, 't'
  for the treatment effects
  confounded with the mean,
  'b' for the block-and-treatment effects confounded with the mean,
  'w' for the weight profiles}
\item{save}{ an optional string to  identify the
  type of information to return. The recognized letters are:

### Creation of a "listofdesignkeys" object
K0 <- planor.designkey(factors=c("R","C","U","A","B1","B2"),
  nlevels=c(3,2,2,3,2,2), model=~R*C + (A+B1+B2)^2, estimate=~A:B1+A:B2,
  nunits=12, base=~R+C+U, max.sol=2)
## Method summary applied on a "keymatrix" object
r <- summary(K0[[1]][[1]])
## Method summary applied on a "designkey"  object
summary(K0[1], save=NULL)
# Method summary applied on the "listofdesignkeys" object
r <-summary(K0, show="dt")

### Creation of a "listofkeyrings" object
K0 <- planor.designkey(factors=c(LETTERS[1:4], "block"), nlevels=rep(3,5),
   model=~block+(A+B+C+D)^2, estimate=~A+B+C+D,
   nunits=3^3, base=~A+B+C, max.sol=2)
# Method summary applied on the "keymatrix" object
r <-summary(K0[[1]][[1]])
# Method summary applied on the "keyring" object
r <-summary(K0[[1]])
