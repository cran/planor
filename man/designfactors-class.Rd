\title{Class \code{"designfactors"} and methods of the class}

\description{An S4 class to represent the design factors in the
  \pkg{planor} package and to store their characteristics.}

\section{Objects from the Class}{
  Objects from this class can be created explicitly by calls to
  \code{\link{planor.factors}} or implicitly by functions such as
  \code{\link{planor.designkey}}.}

\section{Slots}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{fact.info}:}{a dataframe with one row per factor and
  with columns progressively storing information on the factors, in
  particular their numbers of levels (\code{nlev}).}
    \item{\code{pseudo.info}:}{a dataframe with one row per pseudofactor
  and with columns progressively storing information on the
  pseudofactors.}
    \item{\code{levels}:}{a list of numeric or character vectors, with
      each vector containing the levels of one factor.}
  }
}

\section{Methods}{
  \describe{
    \item{[}{ extract a subset of factors and update all the
  slots.}
    \item{bind}{ bind two objects of the class and update all the
  slots. See \code{\link[=bind-method]{bind-method}}.}
    \item{length}{return the  number of factors. }
    \item{names}{return the names of the factors. }
	 }
}

\section{Details}{ Depending on the context and on the construction
  stage, \code{fact.info} may contain logical columns that identify the
  block factors (\code{block}), the ordered factors (\code{ordered}),
  the basic factors (\code{basic}) and so on. It may also include
  columns that store the information on the hierarchy relationships
  between factors, if any.

  In \pkg{planor}, factors are systematically decomposed into
  pseudofactors which all have a prime number of levels and which play a
  key role in the design generation. The information on the
  pseudofactors is stored in the \code{pseudo.info} slot. In addition to
  the columns of \code{fact.info}, it contains a column (called
  \code{parent}) to give the factor that each pseudofactor
  decomposes.}
