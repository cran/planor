	* In compiled code, register native routines and disable 
	symbol search (file src/planor.cpp).

2017-02-21
	* Add the file src/Makevars to link LAPACK and BLAS
	librairies which are used by RcppArmadillo (required on 
	Windows platforms). 
	* In the C programs 'designkeynonsym' and 'designkeysym',
	replace the call to the R function "sample" by a call to
	"runif" which is part of Rcpp.

2017-02-09
	* Function planor.designkey : add a warning when arguments
	are ignored.

2016-10-20
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.3-0
	* Convert the C/C++ programms into Rcpp syntax
	* Code by C++ programs the main loop of planor.designkey 
	(except in case of recursion)
	* Fix a bug in function "generate.model": when the resolution
	is odd, and no estimate is provided, estimate is set to ~1
	instead of the model formulae.

2016-09-21
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.2-1
	* Add an algorithm in planor.designkey which exploits
	symmetries 

2016-09-07
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.1-1
	* Function convertfrom.basep returns a 64-bit integer
	to take into account cases with a great number of 
	factors or levels

	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.0-1
	* Fix a bug in file planor.R, function regular.design:
	there was a double-comma between two arguments in the call to
	planor.design

2016-01-17 Herve Monod
	* if nunits is missing, it is now calculated as the product
	of the numbers of levels of the base factors; error now only
	occurs if both arguments are missing or they are incompatible 
	* bugs corrected to handle trivial cases (e.g. both model and
	estimate formulae are empty)
	* more informative error and warning messages when nunits is
	missing and for some misspecifications of the model and
	estimate formulae
	* error message when factors and nlevels do not correspond
	* error message when the order of the factor names is not 
	compatible with a hierarchy relationship
	* error message reformulated when the numbers of levels of 
	factors involved in a hierarchy are not coherent
	* error message when there is not a solution for all primes

2015-07-08
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 0.2-5
	* Warn when the planor.max.print option limits the number
	of rows/columns of the matrix printed by C programs
	* Set the storage mode of the structures which contain
	integer numbers to "integer" rather then the default mode
	(i.e "double" in R)
	* Some changes to speed execution

2015-06-16
	* Fix a bug in function planor.designkey and regular.design:
	when there is no solution, return NULL
