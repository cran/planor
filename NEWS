	* File DESCRIPTION:  Maintainer: Hervé Monod <Herve.Monod@inra.fr>
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.3-8
	* File creation: planor/scr/init.c (to sort a problem with calling libpack)

	*   where pathP is the path to planor

	* The package maintainer is now H. Monod
	* Thanks to Annie Bouvier for taking care of planor so efficiently until now

2017-06-02
	* Function planor.designkey: when no solution found at 
	any of the primes, stop with an error at the end of the 
	process. Previously, stop with an error only when no solution 
	found at the last prime.

2017-02-23
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.3-6
	* In compiled code, register native routines and disable 
	symbol search (file src/planor.cpp).

2017-02-21
	* Add the file src/Makevars to link LAPACK and BLAS
	librairies which are used by RcppArmadillo (required on 
	Windows platforms). 
	* In the C programs 'designkeynonsym' and 'designkeysym',
	replace the call to the R function "sample" by a call to
	"runif" which is part of Rcpp.

2017-02-09
	* Function planor.designkey : add a warning when arguments
	are ignored.

2016-10-20
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.3-0
	* Convert the C/C++ programms into Rcpp syntax
	* Code by C++ programs the main loop of planor.designkey 
	(except in case of recursion)
	* Fix a bug in function "generate.model": when the resolution
	is odd, and no estimate is provided, estimate is set to ~1
	instead of the model formulae.

2016-09-21
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.2-1
	* Add an algorithm in planor.designkey which exploits
	symmetries 

2016-09-07

	factors or levels

2016-06-30
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 1.0-1
	* Fix a bug in file planor.R, function regular.design:
	there was a double-comma between two arguments in the call to
	planor.design

2016-01-17 Herve Monod
	* if nunits is missing, it is now calculated as the product
	of the numbers of levels of the base factors; error now only
	occurs if both arguments are missing or they are incompatible 
	* bugs corrected to handle trivial cases (e.g. both model and
	estimate formulae are empty)
	* more informative error and warning messages when nunits is
	missing and for some misspecifications of the model and
	estimate formulae
	* error message when factors and nlevels do not correspond
	* error message when the order of the factor names is not 
	compatible with a hierarchy relationship
	* error message reformulated when the numbers of levels of 
	factors involved in a hierarchy are not coherent
	* error message when there is not a solution for all primes

2015-07-08
	* File DESCRIPTION:  planor version is 0.2-5
	* Warn when the planor.max.print option limits the number
	of rows/columns of the matrix printed by C programs
	* Set the storage mode of the structures which contain
	integer numbers to "integer" rather then the default mode
	(i.e "double" in R)
	* Some changes to speed execution

	when there is no solution, return NULL
