	* if nunits is missing, it is now calculated as the product
	of the numbers of levels of the base factors; error now only
	occurs if both arguments are missing or they are incompatible 
	* bugs corrected to handle trivial cases (e.g. both model and
	estimate formulae are empty)
	* more informative error and warning messages when nunits is
	missing and for some misspecifications of the model and
	estimate formulae
	* error message when factors and nlevels do not correspond
	* error message when the order of the factor names is not 
	compatible with a hierarchy relationship
	* error message reformulated when the numbers of levels of 
	factors involved in a hierarchy are not coherent
	* error message when there is not a solution for all primes
