Preliminary step 1 : processing the model specifications
Preliminary step 2 : performing prime decompositions on the factors
Main step for prime p = 2 : key-matrix search
  => search for columns 4 to 6 
      first visit to column 4 
      first visit to column 5 
      first visit to column 6 
The search is closed: max.sol =  2 solution(s) found 
Main step for prime p = 3 : key-matrix search
  => search for column 3 .
      first visit to column 3 
The search is closed: max.sol =  2 solution(s) found
