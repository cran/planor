Warning message:
In planor.modelterms(model) :
  The factorial term A:B1 is present in the estimate formula 1 but not all of its marginal terms. Consequently, this or these marginal terms will be considered of no interest and may be unestimable in the final design.
The factorial term A:B2 is present in the estimate formula 1 but not all of its marginal terms. Consequently, this or these marginal terms will be considered of no interest and may be unestimable in the final design.
