Preliminary step 1 : processing the model specifications
Preliminary step 2 : performing prime decompositions on the factors
*** Main step for prime p = 3 : key-matrix search
  => search for columns 8 to 10 
      first visit to column 8
    ---    col. 8 ( j = 1) 1808 initial candidates
      first visit to column 9
    ---    col. 9 ( j = 2) 1808 initial candidates
    ---    col. 9 ( j = 2) 1660 selected candidates
      first visit to column 10
