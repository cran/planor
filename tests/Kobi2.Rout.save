Preliminary step 1 : processing the model specifications
Preliminary step 2 : performing prime decompositions on the factors
Main step for prime p = 2 : key-matrix search
  => search for columns 4 to 6 
      first visit to column 4
      first visit to column 5
    ---    col. 5 ( j = 2) 8 selected candidates
      first visit to column 6
    ---    col. 6 ( j = 3) 9 selected candidates
The search is closed: max.sol = 2 solution(s) found 
Main step for prime p = 3 : key-matrix search
  => search for column 3 .
      first visit to column 3
The search is closed: max.sol = 2 solution(s) found
